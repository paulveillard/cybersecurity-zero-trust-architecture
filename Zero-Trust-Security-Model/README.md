## History

For years, security has been synonymous with the perimeter security model. This model relies on the strength of its outer defenses. That is, your corporate network is safe so long as your perimeter is impenetrable. Perimeter security typically incorporates tools like firewalls, network segmentation, and VPNs. But perimeter securityâ€™s shortcomings have become apparent as:

- Software is shipped differently now. Organizations now deploy code outside their perimeter, in public and private clouds.
- Workforce habits are changing. A majority of the global workforce now works remotely at least one day a week.
- Remote workers want an equivalent user-experience. Traditional tools for internal access like VPNs are clunky and frustrating to use.
- There are now many perimeters to secure and boundaries of the perimeter have become ephemeral and nebulous.

> Most networks [have] big castle walls, hard crunchy outer shell, and soft gooey centers...
>
> [Rob Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Joyce) [Chief of Tailored Access Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations), [National Security Agency @ ENIGMA 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDJb8WOJYdA&feature=youtu.be&t=1627)

Most importantly, the model is just not as secure as we thought. Recent high-profile breaches have demonstrated how difficult it is for even large companies with sophisticated security organizations to avoid a breach. To pick just two of many breaches, consider the Target and Google hacks. In Target's case, hackers circumvented both the physical and network perimeter by [hacking the HVAC system](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/) which was connected to the internal corporate network from which hackers were then able to move laterally and exfiltrate customer credit card data. In Google's case, they experienced a devastating attack at the hands of the Chinese military known as [Operation Aurora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora). After which, Google did a bottom up review of their security posture. The resulting actions from that review would be released as a [series of white papers](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43231) called "BeyondCorp" which have since become foundational documents in articulating how and why an organization could move beyond corporate perimeter (BeyondCorp...get it?) based security.

> In reality, there's never one front door; there are many front doors...[and] ... we're not securing a single castle. We're starting to think about securing many different interconnected castles.

> [Armon Dadgar, Cofounder of HashiCorp @ PagerDuty Nov 2018](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/how-zero-trust-networking)

The other side of the security trade-off is operational agility. Perimeter based approaches tend to focus on network segmentation which entails creating virtual or physical boundaries around services that need to communicate. Making those boundaries is increasingly difficult to manage in a world of micro-services, and cloud computing where service communication requirements are constantly in flux.

In theory, an organization could "micro/nano/pico-segment" each and every layer of an application stack to ensure appropriate access controls. However, in practice, operators are usually pulled in the direction of one of two extremes. That is, either a very precise boundary that is high-touch, time-consuming to manage, and error prone. Or that of a more lax boundary that may entail more risk but is less time consuming to update, manage and less prone to break.

### Gaps in the perimeter

In summary, perimeter based security suffers from the following shortcomings:

- Perimeter security largely ignores the insider threat.
- The "impenetrable fortress" model fails in practice even for the most sophisticated of security organizations.
- Network segmentation is a time-consuming, and difficult to get exactly right mechanism for ensuring secure communication.
- Even just defining what the network perimeter is is an increasingly difficult proposition in a remote-work, BYOD, multi-cloud world. Most organizations are a heterogeneous mix of clouds, servers, devices, and organizational units.
- VPNs are often misused and exacerbate the issue by opening yet another door into your network organization.

perimeter security is not defunct_, nor is zero-trust security a panacea or a single product. Many of the ideas and principles of perimeter security are still relevant and are part of a holistic, and wide-ranging security policy. After all, we still want our castles to have high walls.

## Tenets of Zero-Trust

- **Assume a Hostile Environment** - There are malicious personas both inside and outside the network. All users, devices, and networks/environments are treated as untrusted.
- **Presume Breach** - There are hundreds of attempted cybersecurity attacks against any networks every day. Consciously operate and defend resources with the assumption that an adversary has presence within your environment. Enhanced scrutiny of access and authorization decisions to improve response outcomes.
- **Never Trust, Always Verify** - Deny access by default. Every device, user, application/workload, and data flow are authenticated and explicitly authorized using least privilege, multiple attributes and dynamic cybersecurity policies.
- **Scrutinize Explicitly** - All resources are consistently accessed in a secure manner using multiple attributes (dynamic and static) to derive confidence levels for contextual access to resources. Access to resources is conditional and access can dynamically change based on action and confidence levels resulting from those actions.
- **Apply Unified Analytics and Automation** - Apply unified analytics for Data, Applications, Assets, Services (DAAS) to include behavioristics, and log each transaction.

## Pillars of Zero-Trust

- **Identities** - They can represent people, services, or IOT devices.
- **Devices** - Having the ability to identify, authenticate, authorize, inventory, isolate, secure, remediate, and control all devices.
- **Network** - Segment (both logically and physically), isolate, and control the network/environment (on-premises and off-premises) with granular access and policy restrictions.
- **Data** - Data discovery, governance, classification, and tagging.
- **Applications/Workloads** - Includes tasks on systems or services on-premises, as well as applications or services running in a cloud environment.
- **Analytics/Automation** - Detection of events, incidents, anomalous behavior, performance and activity baseline. Automated policiy based decisons and SOAR capabilities.

## Logical Components of Zero Trust Architecture

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68043327/121351031-539ad500-c8f9-11eb-973c-123a8e801fe4.png)


- **Policy engine (PE)**: This component is responsible for the ultimate decision to grant access to a resource for a given subject.
- **Policy administrator (PA)**: This component is responsible for establishing and/or shutting down the communication path between a subject and a resource (via commands to relevant PEPs).
- **Policy enforcement point (PEP)**: This system is responsible for enabling, monitoring, and eventually terminating connections between a subject and an enterprise resource.

## Zero Trust Architecture Approaches

- **Enhanced Identity Governance** - Enterprise resource access policies are based on identity and assigned attributes. The primary requirement for resource access is based on the access privileges granted to the given subject. Other factors such as device used, asset status, and environmental factors may alter the final confidence level calculation (and ultimate access authorization) or tailor the result in some way, such as granting only partial access to a given data source based on network location.

- **Logical micro-segmentation** - In this approach, the enterprise places infrastructure devices such as intelligent switches (or routers) or next generation firewalls (NGFWs) or special purpose gateway devices to act as PEPs protecting each resource or small group of related resources. Alternatively (or additionally), the enterprise may choose to implement host-based micro-segmentation using software agents.

- **Software Defined Perimeters** - This can be achieved by using an overlay network (i.e., layer 7 but also could be set up lower of the OSI network stack). These approaches are sometimes referred to as software defined perimeter (SDP) approaches and frequently include concepts from Software Defined Networks (SDN).

## Further reading

The zero-trust security model was first articulated by [John Kindervag](http://www.virtualstarmedia.com/downloads/Forrester_zero_trust_DNA.pdf) in 2010, and by Google in 2011 as a result of the [Operation Aurora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora) breach.
